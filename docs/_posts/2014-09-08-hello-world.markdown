This post is titled as per long-standing programmers' tradition of starting with something new. But of course, chances are you're a programmer yourself so you already know this.

Finally I have my own blog. Which is to say, finally I have a blog that I can call entirely my own, from the nuts and bolts to the lettering, thanks to the brilliant developers at [Jekyll][jekyll], [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [GitHub][github].

I have a thing for appearance. Anything that does not look good must be customised to look good. Ergo, I spend good many hours trying to make things appear just the way I like it. Maybe this is why my webpage was so late in coming. Let it suffice to say that I  had three design candidates for my homepage being developed in parallel at one point of time just because I wanted to pick one which looks the best when I'm done with it. But then appearance without utility is boring, and I had no immediate utility for my webpage, however wonderful I think it looks. So a few days after it began, my webpage development was shelved.

Enter my blogging frustration. As someone tired of the lack of customizability offerred by WordPress and the likes, the promise of a self-designed blog hosted for free was too alluring to resist. Just as Tom Preston-Werner [intended][tpw_blog_jekyll], the combination of Jekyll & GitHub Pages is ideal for the code-loving writer or the blog-loving coder. With this new-found utility in having a website, its development was back on track. And now, a few days later, I'm proud to present my final result - my very own website.

My own, my precious [[1]][precious].
