It's exam season. It's that time of the year again.

For me, exam seasons are special. They're perhaps the only times when academics are your only concern, and everything else that you're working on just disappears into thin air. When no one questions you about assignments, emails you asking for work updates, calls you for lunches, brunches or dinners. A time when everyone is fighting a battle of his own. A time when each forgets the existance of the other and you suddenly are left alone with no responsibilites, no expectations, no deadlines (but the muffled voice in your head counting down the hours until exam time). Nothing but a serenity that pervades.

I enjoy these moments of solitude. Sure, the prospect of exams lurking round the corner is not exactly heart-warming, and no one hates exams more than I (at least since JEE). But the little joys these times bring make them somehow bearable :

_Waking up refreshed after long sleep, one not cut short by the alarm clock._

_The lazy mornings, with no classes or meetings in the calendar._

_Evening snacks by the grassy playground, sipping hot tea in the verandah._

_Fixing yourself some coffee to the accompaniment of soft music and cold breeze._

For me this is the one redeeming aspect of exam season in KGP - the  calm. Preceding a storm, yes, but a welcome change nevertheless.
