This post is title "Hello World", as per long-standing tradition of starting something new. But of course, chances are you're a programmer yourself so already know this.

So, finally I have my own blog. Which is to say, finally I have a blog that I can call entirely my own, from the nuts and bolts to the letters, thanks to the brilliant developers at [Jekyll][jekyll], [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and [GitHub][github]. Check them out if you haven't already.

I have a thing for appearance. Anything that does not look good must be customised to look good. Ergo, I spend a good many hours trying to make things appear just the way I like it. Maybe this is why my webpage was so late in coming.

As Tom Preston-Werner [intended][tpw_blog_jekyll], the combination of Jekyll & GithHub Pages is ideal for the code-loving writer or the blog-loving coder.
So it's small wonder that Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets, like so:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
